# mandelbrot
This is a mandelbrot generator written in C++ MFC. Some work still needs to be done with the zoom feature. This was based on a course that I took on Udemy by John Purcell. I decided to expand on the console application and make a GUI. Work in progress..

Current work that needs to be improved:
Error handling
Zoom reliability
Code formatting
